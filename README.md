--> Sukuna Chatbot

A sarcastic, edgy, and funny terminal-based chatbot inspired by **Ryomen Sukuna**, the King of Curses from *Jujutsu Kaisen*.

This bot will insult you, crack jokes, and talk like the strongest â€” until you say "bye".

- Generates random developer jokes using `pyjokes`
- Always stays in character â€” cocky and cursed ðŸ˜¤
